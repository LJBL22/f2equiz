# Frontend quiz app

### A quiz app built with React Rudux and TailwindCSS

The new skills/tips I utilized in this side project include:

- React Redux state management
- Tailwind CSS
- prefers-color-scheme to change dark/light mode
- Vercel fake JSON API deployment

### DEMO [LINK](https://f2equiz.vercel.app)

### Features

**Users should be able to:**

- Select a quiz subject
- Select a single answer from each question from a choice of four
- See an error message when trying to submit an answer without making a selection
- See if they have made a correct or incorrect choice when they submit an answer
- Move on to the next question after seeing the question result
- See a completed state with the score after the final question
- Play again to choose another subject
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Change the app's theme between light and dark

**In progress**:

- Navigate the entire app only using their keyboard
